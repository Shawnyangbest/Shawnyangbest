## Theme 1: Systemic consequence of climate change 
**Focus:** Network contagion, default cascades, spillover loss, Bayesian learning of regional economic damages of climate change and its spatial dependence.

**Working papers:**

*Spillover Losses in Reinsurance Network under Common Shocks* (with Hua Chen and Qihe Tang)

We construct a reinsurance network in which (re)insurers transfer insured risks through reinsurance and retrocession contracts. We study systemic risk measured by spillover losses arising when liability payoffs are reduced due to cascading defaults. Under tail dependence in primary losses, we examine how network integration shapes spillover losses and find a generally U-shaped relationship between integration and systemic risk. We further implement a leave-one-out (LOO) approach to identify systemically important reinsurers and validate their importance using bailout tests. Extensive simulations calibrated to U.S. Property and Casualty reinsurance data support the key findings.


*Bayesian Learning of Regional Economic Impacts of Climate Change* (with Qihe Tang)

We develop a Bayesian learning framework to study deep uncertainty in the economic impacts of climate change across regions. We disaggregate GDP losses from climate damages to capture regional heterogeneity and incorporate spatial dependence to reflect cross-regional correlations. The framework enables joint learning across regions by leveraging shared information. We characterize uncertainty reduction dynamics and estimate the time required to reach target confidence levels in damage assessments across countries and sectors. Joint learning converges faster than individual learning when uncertain parameters follow a multivariate normal distribution. The empirical application uses the FUND dataset and IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).

## Theme 2: Electricity price forecasting with spatial-temporal weather indices
**Focus:** Day-ahead price forecasting with interpretable time-series models and spatial-temporal weather indices.

**Working paper:**

*Forecasting Australian Electricity Spot Prices with Spatial-temporal Weather Indices* (with Katja Ignatieva and Han Li)

We improve day-ahead electricity price forecasting in Australia by integrating linear time-series models with external spatial-temporal weather indices and demand factors. The model accommodates multiple seasonalities and employs distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to capture delayed and non-linear effects of weather variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed) on price formation. Using a backfitting strategy, we develop a stable and interpretable forecasting framework that is well suited to incorporating weather predictions. Overall, the results demonstrate the value of spatial-temporal weather indices for electricity price forecasting.
