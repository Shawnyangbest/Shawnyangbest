## Theme 1: Systemic Consequence of Climate Change 
**Focus:** Network contagion; default cascades; regional economic damages; spatial dependence.

**Spillover Losses in Reinsurance Network under Common Shocks** (with Qihe Tang and Hua Chen)

We construct a reinsurance network where (re)insurers engage in reinsurance and retrocession transactions to transfer insured risks from policyholders. We investigate systemic risk within this network framework, measured by spillover loss occurring when liability
payoffs decrease due to cascading defaults. Under tail dependence between primary losses, we analyze how integration of the reinsurance network shapes its spillover loss. Our findings reveal that integration exhibits a U-shaped relationship with spillover loss in reinsurance networks. We further implement a leave-one-out (LOO) approach to identify systemically important reinsurers and validate their importance through tests of bailout. Using data from the U.S. Property and Casualty reinsurance market, we identify a core-periphery structure and conduct extensive simulations that support our key findings.

**Bayesian Learning of Regional Economic Impacts of Climate Change** (with Qihe Tang)

We develop a Bayesian learning framework to study deep uncertainty in the economic impacts of climate change across regions. We disaggregate GDP losses from climate damages to capture regional heterogeneity and incorporate spatial dependence to reflect cross-regional correlations. The framework enables joint learning across regions by leveraging shared information. We characterize uncertainty reduction dynamics and estimate the time required to reach target confidence levels in damage assessments across countries and sectors. Joint learning converges faster than individual learning when uncertain parameters follow a multivariate normal distribution. The empirical application uses the FUND dataset and IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs).

## Theme 2: Electricity Price Forecasting with Weather Indices
**Focus:** Day-ahead forecasting; interpretable models.

**Forecasting Australian Electricity Spot Prices with Spatial-temporal Weather Indices** (with Katja Ignatieva and Han Li)

We improve day-ahead electricity price forecasting in Australia by integrating linear time-series models with external spatial-temporal weather indices and demand factors. The model accommodates multiple seasonalities and employs distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) to capture delayed and non-linear effects of weather variables (temperature, precipitation, humidity, wind speed) on price formation.
