We construct a reinsurance network where (re)insurers engage in reinsurance and retrocession transactions to transfer insured risks from policyholders. We investigate systemic risk within this network framework, measured by spillover loss occurring when liability payoffs decrease due to cascading defaults. Under tail dependence between primary losses, we analyze how integration of the reinsurance network shapes its spillover loss. Our findings reveal that integration generally exhibits a U-shaped relationship with systemic risk in reinsurance networks. We further implement a leave-one-out (LOO) approach to identify systemically important reinsurers and validate their importance through tests of bailout. Extensive simulations using reinsurance data from the U.S. Property and Casualty insurance market support our key findings.
